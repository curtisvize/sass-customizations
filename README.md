This repository currently has one file (store_customizations.sass) but I may add more in the future or build this out into something more user-friendly.

The purpose is to have an accessible place where common requests for store customizations can be easily found and copy/pasted into a merchant's Sass code. A cheat sheet if you will.

These code snippets should be added to `responsive/partials/_page.sass` at the end of the file with any other custom styles live for that merchant.
